- 👋 Hi, I'm @JackRabbit21
- 🧬 I'm a bioinformatician passionate about Neural Networks and single‑cell analysis.
- 💼 My portfolio includes projects like:
  - 🧠 Alzheimer's Disease Prediction using neural networks (see `PortfolioPROJECTS/Neural_Network_AlzheimersDisease`).
  - 🧬 Breast Cancer Expression analysis and biomarkers prediction.
  - 🧒‍🎓 Drug discovery projects leveraging machine learning.
  - ⚗️ Fine‑tuning a chemical language model for lipophilicity prediction.
  - 🔍 Single‑cell ATAC‑seq analysis with ArchR for chromatin accessibility profiling.
  - 🦢 Spatial transcriptomics analysis for cell‑type identification and gene expression profiling.
  - 🧬 Single‑cell RNA‑seq analysis for cell type identification.
  - 📊 Data science explorations like movie correlations, housing data cleaning, and more.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning advanced neural architectures and applying them to real‑world problems in neurodegenerative disease research and financial markets.
