- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @JackRabbit21
- ğŸ§  I love exploring Neural Networks and their applications.
- ğŸ’¼ My portfolio includes projects like:
  - ğŸ§  Alzheimer's Disease Prediction using neural networks (see `PortfolioPROJECTS/Neural_Network_AlzheimersDisease`).
  - ğŸ§¬ Breast Cancer Expression analysis and biomarkers prediction.
  - ğŸ¦¥ Drug discovery projects leveraging machine learning.
  - ğŸ“Š Data science explorations like movie correlations, housing data cleaning, and more.
- ğŸŒ± I'm currently learning advanced neural architectures and applying them to real-world problems in neurodegenerative disease research and financial markets.
